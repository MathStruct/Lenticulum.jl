**Category theory** is a branch of mathematics that studies abstract structures and relationships between them, providing a unifying language for mathematics through the concepts of [[category|categories]], [[functor|functors]], and [[natural transformation|natural transformations]].

## Historical Development

Category theory was introduced by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]] in 1945 to study [[algebraic topology]], particularly [[homology]] and [[cohomology]]. It has since become a foundational framework spanning pure mathematics, [[computer science]], [[physics]], and [[logic]].

## Fundamental Concepts

### Categories

A [[category]] $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:

- A collection of [[Object|objects]]
- [[Morphism|Morphisms]] (arrows) between objects
- [[Composition]] of morphisms
- [[Identity morphism|Identity morphisms]]

satisfying [[associativity]] and [[unit law|unit laws]].

### Functors

A [[functor]] $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ preserves the categorical structure:

- Maps objects to objects: $F: \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}) \to \text{Ob}(\mathcal{D})$
- Maps morphisms to morphisms: $F: \mathcal{C}(A,B) \to \mathcal{D}(F(A), F(B))$
- Preserves [[composition]] and [[identity morphism|identities]]

### Natural Transformations

A [[natural transformation]] $\alpha: F \Rightarrow G$ between [[functor|functors]] $F, G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ provides a systematic way to transform one functor into another while respecting the categorical structure.

## Core Principles

### Universality

[[Universal property|Universal properties]] characterize mathematical objects by their relationships rather than internal structure, leading to concepts like [[limit|limits]], [[colimit|colimits]], and [[adjunction|adjunctions]].

### Duality

The [[opposite category]] $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}$ reverses all arrows, leading to [[duality principle|duality principles]] that relate concepts like [[product]] ↔ [[coproduct]], [[limit]] ↔ [[colimit]].

### Functoriality

Mathematical constructions should be [[functor|functorial]], preserving structure across categories and providing systematic ways to transform problems.

## Major Areas
