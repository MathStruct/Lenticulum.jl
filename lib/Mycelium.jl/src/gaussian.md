Implements: the Mycelium belief interface for `LenticulumCore.GaussianBelief`.

## 1. The rules

| function | for Gaussians |
|---|---|
| `combine` | addition of canonical parameters: exact, associative, total |
| `combine` with a `DiracBelief` | the Dirac wins (the $\Lambda \to \infty$ limit) |
| `belief_logdensity` | closed form; proper beliefs only |
| `variable_entropy` | $\tfrac n2(1 + \log 2\pi) - \tfrac12\log\det\Lambda$, may be negative |
| `belief_distance` | max-norm on $(\eta, \Lambda)$, defined for improper beliefs too |
| `can_damp`, `_damp` | convex combination of canonical parameters |
| `_product` | the pooled Gaussian and its log-overlap, for mixture components |

## 2. History

These methods were in the top-level `Lenticulum` package with the type, as extensions of
Mycelium's functions. They moved here when the type moved to `LenticulumCore`
([[gaussian_belief]] §2), so that the rules sit beside the categorical and mixture rules in
[[messages]]. The code is unchanged.
