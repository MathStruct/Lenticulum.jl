# passing.jl — implementation note

Implements: executing a schedule. `step!` → `sweep!` → `propagate!` → `infer!`.
Theory: [[Messages are Inversions]], [[Loopy Message Passing]].

## `step!` is where the identity lives

For a `:to_variable` task:

```julia
chans  = available_channels(s, g, fid; skip = t.edge)   # ← factor-side exclusion
pol    = resolve_polarity(g, fid, e.channel, chans)
check_legal(g, fid, pol)
prior  = excluded_marginal(s, g, e.variable, t.edge)    # ← variable-side exclusion
belief = factor_message(factor, e.channel, pol, inputs, prior, ps, st)
```

Five lines, and every one of them is a named thing from the paper: the polarity is the
input/output split, the prior is the $\pi$ of $c'_\pi$, the inputs are the $y$, and
`factor_message` is the inversion.

`factor_message`'s generic implementation is `assemble` then `invert` — the composite of
`LenticulumCore`'s two interface functions. Structural factors override it directly, because
for them the lens is trivial and building one would be ceremony.

## `sweep!` has two methods, and the difference is semantic

- **Generic** (sequential, tree, forward-backward): executes **in place**. Later tasks see
  earlier results *within the same sweep*, so information crosses a whole path per sweep.
- **`FloodingSchedule`**: **double buffered**. Every task is computed with `commit = false`
  against the previous sweep's messages, and all results are written afterwards. Information
  crosses one edge per sweep.

The trade is not just speed. On a loopy graph the sequential order *is* a modelling choice made
without noticing; flooding is order-independent.

## Implementation difficulties

### 1. `_inputs` is $O(d_f)$ per channel, so `step!` is $O(d_f^2)$

`_inputs` does a `findfirst` over the factor's edges for each requested channel. For a factor of
degree $d$ that is $O(d^2)$ per message and $O(d^3)$ per factor per sweep. Irrelevant for
degree 2–5, wrong for a factor with a hundred channels. A precomputed `channel → edge` map per
factor in `FactorGraph` would fix it and is the obvious next optimisation.

### 2. `ps`/`st` threading is by name and is not validated

`_subtree(ps, name)` returns `NamedTuple()` when the key is absent, so a **typo in a factor's
name silently yields empty parameters** rather than an error. That is the single most likely
way to get a confusingly wrong answer from this file: a factor trains on nothing and nobody
says so.

`_setsubtree` also `merge`s into the state tree on every message, allocating a fresh
`NamedTuple` each time. Correct (states must not be mutated in place if the caller holds the old
one) but wasteful in the inner loop.

A `validate_parameters(g, ps)` pre-flight check — every learnable factor has an entry, no
entries without a factor — is missing and would be cheap.

### 3. Damping is applied *after* the message is computed, and only to `:to_variable`

`step!` damps the outgoing belief against the previous one on that edge. Variable → factor
messages are never damped, which is the usual convention (they are deterministic pools of
already-damped inputs) but is a convention, not a theorem.

More importantly, damping is a **silent no-op** for every belief type except numeric-payload
Diracs ([[messages]] §4). `propagate!` does not check `can_damp` before promising damping, so a
caller can pass `damping = 0.3` and get none.

### 4. `propagate!` special-cases `TreeSchedule` by type

```julia
if sched isa TreeSchedule
    ... return ConvergenceReport(true, 1, 0.0, "tree schedule: one sweep is exact")
```

The claim "one sweep is exact" is true only if the graph really is a tree — which
`tree_schedule` enforced at construction. So the invariant is carried by the *type*, which is
sound but implicit: a hand-constructed `TreeSchedule(inward, outward)` over a loopy graph would
get a false "exact" report. A `TreeSchedule` carrying the graph it was built for, or a
construction-only inner constructor, would close that hole.

### 5. `infer!` returns four things

`(marginals, report, st, store)`. The `store` is returned because
[[free_energy|`bethe_free_energy`]] needs it, but a four-tuple is a poor interface. An
`InferenceResult` struct with named fields is the obvious improvement and was skipped only to
avoid inventing a type before knowing what else belongs in it.

### 6. Cotangents are not here, deliberately

Gradients with respect to parameters are **not** messages. They are accumulated per factor,
governed by each edge's `AbstractGradientCoupling`, on a **different schedule** — once per
training step, not once per inference sweep.

`optimiser_step` is a separate function from `step!` for exactly this reason. Conflating the two
schedules (updating parameters inside a belief sweep) is a classic source of silent bugs, and
the separation is the main structural decision in this file.

The gradient machinery itself does not exist yet: no AD backend is a dependency, and
`AbstractGradientCoupling` is still inert ([[statistical_game]] §6).
